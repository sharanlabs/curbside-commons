# Task Log

## 2026-06-01 (Session 3d — Operating-system cleanup)

### Tool/Session

Claude Code (Opus 4.8), account 1. Cleanup only — no product build.

### Task

Small operating-system cleanup: reconcile AGENTS.md with RULES.md, make README product-focused, add secrets/commit-hygiene rules, correct git status, set the as-of date, and reframe the next task.

### Skills check

- Task type: documentation cleanup. Relevant skills: none required. Conflicts with RULES.md: none.

### Verification

- Confirmed Git is initialized (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` → true; commit `b57cf2c`). This corrects earlier docs that said "not initialized" (stale — the owner initialized git after the prior session).

### Files Changed

- `AGENTS.md` — now defers to `RULES.md`; dropped "reviewer-first only" framing; added start sequence + summarized ground rules.
- `README.md` — product-focused; Claude Code/Codex moved to a short Development Workflow section and removed from the runtime stack; V1 = "AI-assisted workflow automation", "agentic" reserved for roadmap.
- `RULES.md` — added §11 Secrets, §12 Commit hygiene, §13 Lightweight vs full workflow.
- `CURRENT_TASK.md` — T-001 reframed to "offline thin slice planning + data dictionary"; removed git init; as-of date set to June 1, 2026.
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` — git status corrected; next step/handoff reframed (no git init); as-of date set; Claude Suggestions reconciled.
- `HANDOFF.md` — latest block updated to this cleanup (also touched beyond the listed files because the prior block stated the wrong git status).
- `docs/open-questions.md` — as-of date marked resolved (also touched for consistency with the as-of-date instruction).
- `docs/task-log.md` — this entry.

### Compliance Result

Passed. No product code, no CSV change, no schema, no integration, no credentials, no commit.

### Next Step

Human GO / NO-GO on `docs/plan-reconciliation.md`. On GO, start T-001 (planning + data dictionary only).

## 2026-06-01 (Session 3c — Operating-system setup)

### Tool/Session

Claude Code (Opus 4.8), account 1. Setup only — no product build.

### Task

Create the project operating system so Claude (account 1/2), Claude CLI, Codex, and the human owner can continue from the repo without repeated instructions.

### Skills check

- Task type: governance / process scaffolding (documentation).
- Relevant skills: none required; no UI, data-analysis, or framework skill applied. (Per `RULES.md` §5, recorded that the smallest relevant set was "none.")
- Conflicts with RULES.md: none.

### Files Changed

- Created: `RULES.md`, `CURRENT_TASK.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `docs/dual-model-workflow.md`, `docs/project-narrative.md`, `docs/implementation-journal.md`, `docs/decision-log.md`, `docs/checklists/prevent-repeat-checklist.md`, `docs/prompts/claude-task-template.md`, `docs/prompts/codex-plan-review-template.md`, `docs/prompts/codex-changed-files-review-template.md`, `docs/prompts/codex-rescue-template.md`, `docs/visuals/README.md`, `docs/visuals/architecture.mmd`, `docs/visuals/v1-thin-slice-flow.mmd`, `docs/visuals/dual-model-workflow.mmd`.
- Updated: `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/task-log.md`, `docs/open-questions.md`.

### Verification

- Codex command surface verified against the installed plugin: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/openai-codex/codex/1.0.4/commands/` (v1.0.4). All seven commands confirmed; review-only vs. can-edit distinction taken from the command definitions.
- Mermaid not validated by CLI (mmdc not installed); diagrams use standard syntax.

### Compliance Result

Passed. No product code, no CSV change, no schema, no integration, no credentials.

### Next Step

Human GO / NO-GO on `docs/plan-reconciliation.md`. On GO, start T-001 (`CURRENT_TASK.md`).

## 2026-06-01 (Session 3b — Plan reconciliation)

### Tool/Session

Claude Code, review only (continuation of Session 3).

### Task

Reconcile Codex (initial + open-source) and Claude (governance) findings into one final pre-build decision. No implementation.

### Files Changed

- Created `docs/plan-reconciliation.md`
- Updated `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/task-log.md`, `docs/open-questions.md`

### Summary

- Resolved the core tension: Codex was right about *which* safety controls matter; Claude was right about *sequencing/volume*. Accepted the controls; rejected the docs-first gate.
- Accepted: header fix, required field set built into the slice, documented risk formula + step/blocker taxonomy (step order recovered from existing nudges), deterministic-before-AI, structured JSON + validation + forbidden-claims, idempotency, model_runs ledger, defer live integrations, drop "agentic".
- Rejected: the 7-doc prerequisite gate, the 14-table V1 schema, `ALWAYS_READ.md`/template/retro-audit as blockers, any live external send in V1, the blended readiness score.
- Fixed V1 scope: one offline runnable slice (ingest→normalize→deterministic risk/blocker→review queue→one stubbed structured draft + forbidden-claims check→simulated send + idempotency + audit/model_runs), tests = acceptance criteria. Storage = one entity CSV + append-only event logs.
- Planning exit condition: user GO/NO-GO on the reconciliation. No further review docs.
- First implementation task on GO: git init; RULES.md + v1-data-dictionary.md; ingest/normalize → merchants_v1.csv.

### Compliance Result

Passed. Review-only; no code, schema, workflow, credentials, or CSV mutation.

### Next Step

User GO/NO-GO on `docs/plan-reconciliation.md`. If GO, build (do not write more docs).

## 2026-06-01 (Session 3 — Claude governance & idea review)

> Ordering note: this session ran after the entries below despite the earlier calendar date. Prior entries are dated 2026-06-02; the authoritative current date is 2026-06-01. The folder is not in git, so there is no commit history to arbitrate — this discrepancy is itself recorded as a minor governance finding (weak audit trail).

### Tool/Session

Claude Code, devil's-advocate review only.

### Task

Review whether the project rules, governance process, and project idea are clear enough for a serious AI automation build using Claude Code and Codex. No implementation.

### Scope

- Review and documentation only.
- No CSV modification, schema, workflow, or integration code.
- No credentials.

### Files Read

- `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CODEX.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/product-brief.md`, `docs/task-log.md`, `docs/open-questions.md`, `docs/data-audit.md`
- `docs/reviews/codex-initial-review.md`, `docs/reviews/open-source-validation-review.md`
- `docs/audits/open-source-validation-compliance-audit.md`
- `docs/decisions/ADR-001-initial-architecture.md`
- `DoorDash Merchant Nudge Engine - Merchant Directory.csv`

Requested files that do not exist (recorded, not endorsed as blockers): `ALWAYS_READ.md`, `docs/audits/codex-compliance-audit.md`.

### Files Changed

- Created `docs/reviews/claude-governance-and-idea-review.md`
- Created `docs/audits/claude-governance-compliance-audit.md`
- Updated `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/task-log.md`, `docs/open-questions.md`

### Independent verification performed

- Re-derived the risk formula from the raw CSV; holds on all 20 rows. Distribution 10 Low / 2 Medium / 8 High confirmed. Noted both Medium rows are exactly 69, leaving thresholds essentially unconstrained.
- Spot-checked the two most-suspicious arXiv citations in the open-source review (`2605.07135`, `2603.20847`) via WebFetch; both are real and titles match. Suspicion dropped.

### Summary

- Central finding: governance has outgrown the product (~12 docs, 0 runnable code, 20-row CSV) and the planning phase has no termination condition.
- The canonical rules live in chat prompts, not the repo; "mandatory files" are partly prompt-invented (this prompt named two files that do not exist — the third session to do so).
- The blended readiness score is unanchored and drifted 3→4 without build progress; recommended retiring it for two separate measures.
- Codex largely followed its rules and its citations are real; it did not catch the meta-risk and its self-audit over-credits "Followed" on rules that were N/A.
- Did not re-litigate the (already-correct) data-model critique.

### Compliance Result

Passed. Review-only scope held; evidence verified at primary source; one weak claim corrected before publication.

### Next Step

User go/no-go decision (see `PROJECT_STATE.md` → Current Next Step). Do not write a fourth review document. If GO, build the thin runnable slice in code with tests inline.

## 2026-06-02

### Tool/Session

### Task

Open-source validation review of ActivationOps AI project direction, process, architecture, and prior Codex review.

### Scope

- Analysis and documentation only.
- No implementation.
- No CSV modification.
- No Supabase schema.
- No n8n workflow.
- No Slack or Resend integration code.
- No production code.

### Files Read

- `PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/product-brief.md`
- `docs/task-log.md`
- `docs/open-questions.md`
- `docs/data-audit.md`
- `docs/reviews/codex-initial-review.md`
- `docs/decisions/ADR-001-initial-architecture.md`
- `CODEX.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `DoorDash Merchant Nudge Engine - Merchant Directory.csv`

Missing required files recorded:

- `docs/audits/open-source-validation-compliance-audit.md`
- `PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/task-log.md`
- `docs/open-questions.md`

### Summary

- Validated the project idea as worth building only as a staged dummy-data simulation.
- Confirmed the prior Codex review was fair and stayed reviewer-only.
- Confirmed the current data model still blocks implementation.
- Validated the architecture direction against current official/open sources.
- Raised readiness from 3/10 build readiness to 4/10 overall validation readiness, with implementation still blocked.
- Identified missing governance files as a process blocker.

### Compliance Result

Passed with warnings.

Warnings:

- `ALWAYS_READ.md` is missing.
- `docs/audits/session-compliance-template.md` is missing.
- `docs/audits/codex-compliance-audit.md` is missing.
- V1 dataset acceptance criteria are missing.

### Next Step

Create governance and acceptance-criteria docs before any integration build:

1. `ALWAYS_READ.md`
2. `docs/audits/session-compliance-template.md`
3. `docs/acceptance-criteria/v1-dataset.md`

## 2026-06-01

### Completed

- Read the attached work order.
- Inspected the project folder.
- Confirmed the folder was not a Git repository.
- Confirmed no project-local `AGENTS.md` existed before this pass.
- Located CSV file: `DoorDash Merchant Nudge Engine - Merchant Directory.csv`
- Parsed the CSV with a structured CSV reader.
- Confirmed 20 merchant records and 9 header columns.
- Identified duplicate header issue: both first and second columns are named `Merchant Name`.
- Inferred and verified the synthetic risk score formula across all 20 rows.
- Created documentation scaffolding requested by the work order.
- Wrote CSV data audit.
- Wrote initial critical review.
- Added open questions and initial architecture decision.
- Used two read-only subagents for CSV audit and architecture/security/automation review.
- Checked current official docs for Supabase API/RLS, n8n error handling, Slack request verification/interactivity, Resend webhooks, Gemini structured outputs, and Google Sheets API limits.

### Validation

- Used local folder listing and file search to inspect project structure.
- Used a structured CSV parse to inspect headers, records, value distributions, duplicate merchant names, and scoring consistency.
- No live integrations, workflows, schemas, credentials, or production code were created.

### Remaining

- Generate a V1-ready dummy dataset.
- Decide canonical onboarding steps and blocker taxonomy.
- Define Supabase schema only after the data model is approved.
- Define n8n, Slack, Resend, and Gemini behavior only after workflow safety controls are approved.
